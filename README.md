# The Plant App.


## Building the app
In order to build this app, you will need to clone the Github Repo.
Then run `npm install`.
It will probably ask to install some packages, answer Yes (`Y`) for all of these.

Once everything is built, you should be able to run `npx expo start --tunnel`.

Once that is ready, press `w` to see the app in your browser, or scan the QR-code it generates with your phone.
If you use your phone, it will ask you to install the Expo Go app, so you can run the app on your own device.
(Works on Android and IOS devices).
